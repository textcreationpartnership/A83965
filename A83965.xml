            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Therefore I have thought it, among other things, very profitable to all, that I am deſigned to Treat of it in this Book, in the firſt place to give choice and approved Directions for planting Vines, making Wines, and other Liquors of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after the neweſt Experiments, and how they may be preſerved to be uſed in all Seaſons.</p>

                  <head>Of Vines, and Planting them.</head>
                  <p>THat Vinyards have been frequent in <hi>England</hi> is apparent, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of many places now bearing Corn and Paſture retaining that Name; and it is the Opinion of the moſt Experienced in this way, that the Southern parts of this Iſland, with the Induſtry of the Natives, might produce Vines equal to thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> either for Claret or White-Wines: But before I come directly upon the Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Ordering theſe ſort of Wines, I think it proper to ſay ſomething in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Planting and Managing thoſe Vines, that are to bring forth the Grapes of which Wine is to be made.</p>
                  <p>It is the Planter's buſineſs, in the firſt place, to conſider what Soil is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that which is ſo, muſt be of a niterous, Sulpherous Nature; black, looſe and moiſt, proceeding from its Oyly Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or Fatneſs, of which there is great ſtore in this Kingdom, even in waſt places, that with a little good manuring, would be well improved into Vinyards, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very great Encreaſe; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Manure is a little Lime, mixed with well

And thus have I given you a true Inſight of ordering Vinyards, becauſe it now may prove a nice mattter, as not having been a long time well practiced in <hi>England;</hi> but as for other fruit-bearing trees of the Wine, of whoſe Fruits I ſhall hereafter have occaſion to ſpeak, I ſhall paſs over their manner of planting, and come nearer to what is immediate profitable.</p>

                  <p>IN gathering Fruit in Seaſon, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them to be long laſting, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſhed, there ought to be great care taken; and to do it in general for all Fruits growing on ſtandard-Trees, have ſuch a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as may bear Lightly on the Boughs, ſo as not to Endanger their breaking, and bruiſing the Fruit.</p>
                  <p>Gather your Fruit by the ſtalks to prevent bruiſing of them, do it when they are well ripning, but not over-ripe; and to put them in, have a Basket with a hook to hang on the round of the Ladder, or ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Boughs, laying Fern, or Nettles, in the bottom to keep them from preſſing by their weight too hard, lay them gently in, and as gently out into the Receiver; and never proceed to gather them in a wet day, nor ſo early in the morning that the Sun has not time to draw up the moiſture from them, leſt the dampneſs ſoon periſh them;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153196:67"/>and where Fruit, eſpecially Stone-fruit, is not all ripe at once, gather them as they ripen, and ſo thoſe that remain having the greater advantage of Sap may ripen the kindlier, and grow larger; gather thoſe that have no ſtalks to hold by with a tender hand, lay them not on heaps, but ſingle, on Nettles, or ſome ſuch Weeds not offenſive in ſmell, and they will not only perfect their ripeneſs, but ſweat out their ſuperfluity and be ſweeter in taſte; keep them in dry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and if the Weather be hot, let the cool North, Eaſt or Weſt winds, breath on them by the opening of Windows, or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, in clear, dry days.</p>
                  <p>To know whether Pears or Apples be ripe, gather one from the middle of the Tree, cut it in the middle, and if there be a great hollowneſs, and the kernels ſeem looſe, they are of a ſufficient ripeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Apricots, Nectrines, and ſuch like, are known in ripeneſs, by the ſtones eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Fruit, and growing of a dus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key colour; as for other things your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will direct you, by ſeeing, handling, ſmelling and taſting.</p>
                  <p>When you gather Quinces, rub off gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the woolineſs, pack them in ſtraw, and in a dry Cask, with a layer of Straw between
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153196:67"/>each laying of Fruit, for they are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to mouldineſs and rotting upon the leaſt contracted moiſture, and muſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at a diſtance from other Fruit, becauſe their ſcent is offenſive to them.</p>
                  <p>If you gather Medlars, or Services, you muſt do it before they are ripe, juſt when they are turned brown, and by laying the firſt in ſtraw thinly, and hanging the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon Lines in bunches, they will kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripen of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As for your winter Apples, it is proper to gather them without the ſtalks, becauſe they will ſooneſt periſh and wither.</p>

                  <p>If it be right Ox-Beef, it will have an open Grain; the Fat, if young, of a crumbling or Oi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Cow-Beef is of a cloſer Grain, leſs boned, and of ſomewhat leſs Colour, the Fat whiter; and if young,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153196:92"/>tender, eaſily indented with your Finger, but will in a little time riſe again.</p>
                  <p>Bull-Beef is of a more dusky Red, cloſer and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than either Ox or Cow-Beef, harder to be imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your Finger, and ſuddenly riſing on a light Touch if you do it; the Fleſh brawny, and the Fat groſs, and very fibrous, difficult to melt, and of a ſtrong Scent. And thus, little or more, it will be, If it be the Fleſh of a Beaſt that has not been geld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till grown up to full Bigneſs; and if old, very tough upon pinching, ſo that your Nails will with great difficulty enter it.</p>
                  <p>As for Newneſs or Staleneſs, this ſort of Fleſh has few Signs to the Eye, more than the Appearance of a lively freſh Colour for the firſt, and a darkiſh dull Colour for the latter; but cut in pieces, where the Veins can be diſcern'd, obſerve as in Lamb and Veal.</p>
                  <p>If the Beef has been too ſuddenly kill'd upon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heating in driving, it will ſoon taint, and never take Salt kindly. This you may know by ſqueezing it in any fleſhy part where there are Veins; and with hard ſqueezing, a red Juice will iſſue out, and tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture your Fingers. As for farther Confirmation, if you miſtruſt your Sight, uſe your Scent: Bull-Beef will ſmell ſtrong and Rawmiſh, ſo will that which has been over-heated in driving; and if it be your bad Luck unadviſedly to buy either of theſe to ſalt, make a ſtrong Brine-Pickle, boil'd, and well ſcum'd, and put them into it 24 hours when cold; then take it out, and ſalt it with dry Salt, and it will take much better, becauſe the Brine has firſt penetrated it to make way.</p>
                  <p>If this Meat be bruiſed, that place will look of a dusky Colour to the reſt, as having ſettl'd Blood in it, that in the killing would not evacuate with the other Blood. And for the reſt, uſe your Scent where
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153196:92"/>you ſee Cauſe to ſuſpect; and believe your ſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Butcher's Proteſtations or Oaths.</p>
                  <p>If this ſort of Fleſh be old, ſeveral pieces will, in your Hand, ſhrink a little from the Bone; but if young, it will ſtand firm and well where it is not divided from them by cutting.</p>

                  <p>But if the Lean of it be tough, the Fat very rough, ſpungy, or not expanding well between your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Thumb, and the Skin or Rhind ſtubborn, then is it old, and may be a Pigging Sow; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Fleſh be extraordinary flabby, and the Skin crinkled.</p>
